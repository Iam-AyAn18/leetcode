/*
 * 1970. Last Day Where You Can Still Cross
 * Hard
 *
 * Problem:
 * There is a 1-based binary matrix where 0 represents land and 1 represents water.
 * You are given integers row and col representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
 *
 * Initially on day 0, the entire matrix is land. However, each day a new cell becomes flooded with water.
 * You are given a 1-based 2D array cells, where cells[i] = [ri, ci] represents that on the ith day,
 * the cell on the rith row and cith column (1-based coordinates) will be covered with water (i.e., changed to 1).
 *
 * You want to find the last day that it is possible to walk from the top to the bottom by only walking on land cells.
 * You can start from any cell in the top row and end at any cell in the bottom row.
 * You can only travel in the four cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).
 *
 * Return the last day where it is possible to walk from the top to the bottom by only walking on land cells.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: row = 3, col = 3, cells = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[1,3],[2,3],[3,2],[3,1]]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 2 <= row, col <= 2 * 10^4
 * - 4 <= row * col <= 2 * 10^4
 * - cells.length == row * col
 * - 1 <= ri <= row
 * - 1 <= ci <= col
 * - All the values of cells are unique.
